I went to an interesting meetup in denver created by [Learn Cybersecurity Denver](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Cybersecurity-Denver/), and it was an intro to Capture the flag.

It was really well done, and the challenges were well spread out from true intro, the advanced AppSec.

I however realized in the shower, that I could use the exploit from level 2 on AppSec to write my own terminal and gain access to all the passwords.  I want to contact them and see if they were aware of the secondary attack.

Things I played with:  Directory Traversal attacks and sgid exploits.  It was a brain teaser.
